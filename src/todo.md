## Things to do:
Incremental dev hoolaha

- Aspect ratio
- [ ] User can choose the size of the page but it's for us to decide how to fit the page into the screen
- [ ] user oughta choose the orientation
- [ ] in a future we can warn the user with a little sample on how their pages are going to look in different screen sizes

- render a page with images and text
- [ ] at a first instance we are going to load only the elements of a single page.
- [ ] images and text are consider elements with depth.
- [ ] we are going to have some sort of layers arrangement so one element can be in top of the other one
- [ ] position of elements is going to be absolute, so the size of the screen is going to be important because it is going to alter the position and size of elements

- load elements of a second page and add navigator.
- [ ] the navigator is going to go through the list of pages
- [ ] whenever a single page is selected, it's going to load all the elements of that single page
- [ ] in the future we can include a thumbnail of each page while the elements off the page are loading.
- [ ] with the previous improvement we can also a boy to load all the elements of a page while scrolling through the different pages
